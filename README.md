An add-in for SSMS that can group databases in Object Explorer Tree.

The code is much inspired by https://github.com/nicholas-ross/SSMS-Schema-Folders, and in fact, some of the code was copied from this repo to make the function works :). In the end, it is all open source for every one to use, so feel free to add comment if you have.

The first version is only tested on SSMS 2017, other versions might or might not work.
